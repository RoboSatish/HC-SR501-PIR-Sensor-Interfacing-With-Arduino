# HC-SR501-PIR-Sensor-Interfacing-With-Arduino

The PIR sensor allows you to detect when a person or animal moves in or out of sensor range. This sensor is what you’ll find in most modern security systems, automatic light switches, garage door openers and similar applications where we want to react to motion.
This PIR sensor itself is pretty straightforward and works out of the box. Simply apply power 5V – 12V and ground. The sensor output goes HIGH when motion is detected and goes LOW when idle (no motion detected).
